# sensible_lol.vim

This is a plugin to add additional vim settings that I personally think are needed to get serious work done. This plugin was created with the assumption that [sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) would also be installed because this has been derived from sensible.vim. This is not sensible because these settings are not for everyone and because I am not 100% sensible.

Understanding how I built these vim settings requires you to know what sort of files I edit using vim. I have done work in the following languages and have sculpted settings to better support these languages:

* Python
* Markdown
* Vimscript
